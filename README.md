# RowlandsAdventure2
This is a school project I made for my CSC 165 Game Programming Course at Sacramento State! It is written directly in Java using OpenGL. It is based on a heavily modified version of the TAGE engine used in the class. The game is a 3D platformer inspired by Super Mario Galaxy, with planetoids and gravity fields. Try to reach the end!

## Running
The game is only tested on Windows 11 using Java 17. Make sure Java 17 is your default java installation in the terminal before attempting to run the game. Once that is correct, simply execute runPortable.bat, and the game will start! It will take several minutes to load, give it time.

## Compilation
Just run compile.bat!
